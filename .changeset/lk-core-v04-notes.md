Documentation-only clarifications to two v0.3 behaviours that changed silently for upgraders:

- **Fill-in-the-blanks `caseSensitive` and `trimWhitespace` are classified `answer-key`** and are therefore removed by `redact()`. This is intentional — they describe how strictly the key is compared, so revealing them narrows the answer — but it changed the shape of redacted payloads on upgrade with no type error to warn you. If a renderer read those flags from a redacted payload, it now receives `undefined`. Use `redact(data, { policy: { blanks: { caseSensitive: 'public' } } })` if a deployment genuinely needs them client-side.
- **`ScoringDetail.outcome` is optional in the type but always written** by both built-in scorers. It is a compatibility bridge so v0.2-era consumer-constructed literals keep compiling. **In v1.0 it becomes required and the deprecated `ScoringDetail.correct` is removed.** Migrate reads from `.correct` to `.outcome` now: `.correct` means "the learner acted correctly on this option", which for multiple-choice marks unselected distractors as `true`.
