Hardening: a typecheck gate, descriptor-driven xAPI interop, and an opt-in rounded item threshold.

**The test suites did not compile, and nothing noticed.** `tsc` only ever ran over `src/` as part of the build, so type errors in test files accumulated unseen — and a released defect (`redact()` being uncallable with the SDK's own exported interfaces) survived precisely because the suite that should have caught it was not type-checked. Both packages now have a `typecheck` script covering the full program, tests included, wired into `turbo` and CI. Getting to zero surfaced real problems rather than noise: matcher types that were never in the program (a `vitest-axe` augmentation the package does not ship), a fetch mock whose untyped parameters made `mock.calls[i][1]` an empty tuple so header assertions only compiled behind a cast, and a Node-only `Buffer` in a browser package's test.

**`xapiDefinitionFor(data)` (new).** `ActivityTypeDescriptor.interop` declares the activity-type IRI, the cmi.interaction type and how to derive `correctResponsesPattern` — and had **no reader anywhere**. Every renderer rebuilt the same strings inline, which is the same "declared but never used" defect this SDK has fixed elsewhere. The built-in components now read the descriptor, so a consumer-registered activity type gets correct xAPI interop with no component changes. Returns `{}` for an unregistered type, so it is always safe to spread.

**`computePassThreshold(data, score, rounding?)` — new optional third argument.** Item-level pass/fail still compared raw floats with `>=`, so an item displayed as "70%" could be recorded as a fail at 69.6 — exactly the disagreement `RoundingPolicy` eliminates for assessment totals. Passing a policy compares both sides rounded, via `gte`. It is **opt-in**: enabling it by default would change item-level pass/fail for any score inside the rounding band, and this SDK does not alter historical grades without an explicit decision. Absent, the comparison is bit-for-bit what it has always been.
