Fix package resolution for CommonJS TypeScript consumers, and gate it in CI so it cannot regress.

**A CommonJS TypeScript project could not import these packages at all.** Both `exports` maps declared a single `types` condition pointing at the ESM `.d.ts`, which was then served to `require` as well. TypeScript under `node16`/`nodenext` resolution reported the declaration as ESM and failed the import with `TS1479` ("the current file is a CommonJS module whose imports will produce require calls"). `are-the-types-wrong` flagged every entrypoint as "Masquerading as ESM". The `types` condition is now nested inside each format, so `require` resolves the `.d.cts` declaration that was always being built:

```jsonc
".": {
  "import":  { "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",  "default": "./dist/index.js"  },
  "require": { "types": "./dist/index.d.cts", "default": "./dist/index.cjs" }
}
```

This is a resolution fix only — no build change, no runtime change, no API change. ESM and bundler resolution were already correct and are unaffected. It matters most for server-side use: a Node grading service or queue worker compiled as CommonJS can now `import { evaluate, redact } from '@intellectif/lk-core'` directly, instead of working around it with `await import()` or switching `moduleResolution`.

**Raised the `zod` floor to `^3.25.1` (lk-core).** The previous range allowed `zod@3.25.0`, which declares a `./v4` export whose target files are absent from the published tarball. Since the schema layer imports `zod/v4`, any install that resolved exactly 3.25.0 failed with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` in both ESM and CJS. No supported version is dropped — 3.25.0 was never functional here.

**New CI gate:** `publint` and `are-the-types-wrong` now run on every build (`pnpm check-packaging`). `node10` resolution is deliberately ignored — that is TypeScript before 4.7, and this SDK requires React 19.
